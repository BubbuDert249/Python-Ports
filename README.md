# Python Ports
This repository shows how far Python ports can go <br>
The Blackberry, Tizen and Firefox OS port is just the files zipped <br>
The webOS port required me to make 2 Gzip compressed tarballs (.tar.gz) and a .ar archive (renamed to .ipk) <br>
This bypasses using commands like ares-package <br>
The Firefox OS port is a hybrid app for KaiOS 3.0+ or older and Firefox OS, by combining manifest.json (KaiOS 3.0+) and manifest.webapp (KaiOS 3.0 or older and Firefox OS) <br>
NOTE: The BlackBerry port only works for BlackBerry 8, 9 and 10 <br>
